## Classic Graph ML Tasks

| No  | Application Task     | Description                                               | Examples                        |
| --- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1   | Node classification  | Predict a property of a node                              | Categorise online users / items |
| 2   | Link prediction      | Predict whether there are missing links between two nodes | Knowledge graph completion      |
| 3   | Graph classification | Categorise different graphs                               | Molecule property prediction    |
| 4   | Clustering           | Detect if nodes form a community                          | Social circle detection         |
| 5   | Graph generation     |                                                           | Drug discovery                  |
| 6   | Graph evolution      |                                                           | Physics simulation              |
