## Knowledge Graphs

A knowledge graph (KG) is a structured representation of knowledge that uses a graph-structured data model to capture information about entities and their relationships. 
- This model allows for the integration, organisation, and retrieval of data from multiple sources, making it useful in various domains such as search engines, AI, and data management.

In a graph form,
- Nodes are **entities**
- Nodes are labelled with their **types**
- Edges between two nodes capture **relationships** between entities

KG is an example of a [[Heterogenous Graphs|heterogenous graph]].
