DID is typically used to estimate the effect of a specific intervention or treatment (such as a passage of law, enactment of policy, or large-scale program implementation) by comparing the **changes in outcomes over time** between a population that is enrolled in a program (the intervention group) and a population that is not (the control group).

## Motivation

Context: Treatment and control group both before and after treatment administered.
Advantage: Use time dimension to help with identification.
