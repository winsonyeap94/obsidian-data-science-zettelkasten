# Casual Inference

## What is Causal Inference?

Causal inference is the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">process of determining the independent, actual effect of a particular phenomenon within a larger system, differentiating it from mere associations.</mark>

The key aspects of causal inference are:
- It analyses the response of a **dependent variable (the effect)** to changes in an **independent variable (the cause)**, while controlling for other variables. [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference)
- It goes beyond just identifying associations or correlations between variables, and aims to establish causality - that changes in one variable directly cause changes in another variable. [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference)[3](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-is-causal-inference/)[4](https://clas.ucdenver.edu/marcelo-perraillon/sites/default/files/attached-files/w2_causal_inference_perraillon.pdf)
- It requires a formal language and mathematical framework to articulate causal assumptions, identify causal effects, and draw causal conclusions from data. This includes using tools like structural causal models, potential outcomes, and graphical methods. [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2836213/)
- It is widely used across scientific disciplines, though the specific methods may differ, to understand the underlying causes of phenomena. Common approaches include randomized experiments, statistical adjustment, and other techniques to isolate the causal effect of interest. [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference)[4](https://clas.ucdenver.edu/marcelo-perraillon/sites/default/files/attached-files/w2_causal_inference_perraillon.pdf)
- Establishing causality is challenging, as it requires addressing issues like confounding, selection bias, and the fundamental problem of not being able to observe both potential outcomes for the same unit. Careful study design and analysis is required. [4](https://clas.ucdenver.edu/marcelo-perraillon/sites/default/files/attached-files/w2_causal_inference_perraillon.pdf)[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2836213/)
