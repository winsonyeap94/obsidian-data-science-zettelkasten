# Central Limit Theorem

![[Pasted image 20240505165839.png]]

The central limit theorem in statistics states that, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">given a sufficiently large sample size, the sampling distribution of the mean for a variable will approximate a normal distribution regardless of that variable’s distribution in the population</mark>.

If you take a large enough random sample from any population, the distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal, regardless of the underlying distribution of the population.

Specifically, the CLT states that as the sample size ($n$) increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean ($\bar{X}$) will approach a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ (the population mean) and standard deviation $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ (where σ is the population standard deviation).
