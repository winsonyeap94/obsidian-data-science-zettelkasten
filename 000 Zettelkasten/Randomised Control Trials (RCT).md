# Randomised Control Trials (RCT)

![[Pasted image 20240505173802.png]]

Randomised Control Trials (RCT) is a study design that **randomly assigns participants into an experimental group or a control group**. As the study is conducted, the only expected difference between the control and experimental groups in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the outcome variable being studied.

It is often the *ideal method of analysing the effectiveness of a treatment*, as confounders are controlled for.

## Advantages

Advantages of RCT:
1. Good randomisation will minimise any population bias.
2. Easier to blind/mask than observational studies.
3. Results can be analysed with well-known statistical tools.
4. Populations of participating individuals are clearly identified.

## Disadvantages

However, sometimes we can't always conduct an RCT, and there are some disadvantages:
1. **Ethical reasons** - e.g., unethical to randomise people to smoke for measuring its effect on lung cancer
2. **Infeasibility** - e.g., can't randomise countries into communist/capitalise systems to measure effect on GDP, too expensive in terms of time and money
3. **Impossibility** - e.g., can't change a living person's DNA at birth for measuring effect on breast cancer
5. **Volunteer biases** - The population that participates may not be representative of the whole.

## Alternatives

The alternative which is preferred is known as [[Observational Studies]].

## RCTs are "Magic" - Brady Neal

RCTs are "magical" because of the following properties:
1. **Comparability and covariate balance** - Treatment and control groups are the same in all aspects except treatment
2. **Exchangeability**
3. **No backdoor paths**
