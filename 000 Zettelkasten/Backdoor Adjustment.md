# Backdoor Adjustment

Backdoor adjustment is the process of **adjusting or controlling for confounders**.

It is used as a way to perform causality analysis on [[Observational Studies]], instead of [[Randomised Control Trials (RCT)]].

If $W$ is a sufficient adjustment set, we have:
$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[Y(t) \mid W=w] & = \mathbb{E}[Y \mid \text{do}(T=t), W=w] \\
& = \mathbb{E}[Y \mid t, w]
\end{align}
$$

## Example

Let's take an example where we are comparing the effects of two treatments on a disease.

Notice that how with backdoor adjustment, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the weights are the same between both treatment effects</mark>. Below is how the adjusted calculation compares against the na√Øve example where no adjustments are made.

### Backdoor criterion and backdoor adjustment

A set of variables $W$ satisfies the backdoor criterion relative to $T$ and $Y$ if the following are true:
1. $W$ blocks all backdoor paths from $T$ to $Y$.
2. $W$ does not contain any descendants of $T$.

Given the modularity assumption and that $W$ satisfies the backdoor criterion, we can identify the causal effect of $T$ on $Y$:
$$
P(y \mid do(t)) = \sum_w P(y \mid t,w) P(w)
$$
