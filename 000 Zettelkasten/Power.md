# Power

Power is the **probability that a test of significance will detect a deviation from the null hypothesis, should such a deviation exist**.
- High power in a study indicates a large chance of a test detecting a true effect. 
- Low power means that the test only has a small chance of detecting a true effect or that the results are likely to be distorted by random and systematic error.

Power is mainly influenced by *sample size*, *effect size*, and *significance level*. 

A **power analysis** can be used to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">determine the necessary sample size for a study to have sufficient power</mark> (usually 80% or higher) to detect an effect of a certain size. Having enough statistical power is necessary to draw accurate conclusions about a population using sample data. 

Power is the probability of avoiding a Type II error (failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false).
