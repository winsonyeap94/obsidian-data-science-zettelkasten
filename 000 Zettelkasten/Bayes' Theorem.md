# Bayes' Theorem

The Bayes' Theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes the relationship between conditional probabilities.

$$
\text{Pr}(A\ |\ B) = \frac{\text{Pr}(B\ |\ A)\ \Pr(A)}{\text{Pr}(B)}
$$

The Bayes' Theorem states that for two events A and B, the conditional probability of A given B, denoted as $\text{Pr}(A\ |\ B)$, is equal to the product of the conditional probability of B given A, denoted as  $\text{Pr}(B\ |\ A)$, and the prior probability of A, denoted as $\text{Pr}(A)$, divided by the prior probability of B, denoted as $\text{Pr}(B)$.

## Usage

Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (A) based on new evidence (B). It is widely used in various fields, including:

1. Medical diagnosis - to determine the probability of a disease given the results of a diagnostic test.
2. Machine learning - to classify data based on prior probabilities.
3. Finance - to estimate the probability of a financial event, such as the likelihood of default.
4. Artificial intelligence - to make decisions under uncertainty.
