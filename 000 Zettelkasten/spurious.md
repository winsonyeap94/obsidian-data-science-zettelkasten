# spurious

The term "spurious" refers to something that is **false, inauthentic, or not genuine**. It describes a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">relationship or correlation between two variables that appears to be causal, but is actually due to the influence of a third, hidden variable</mark>. Some key points about spurious relationships:

- A spurious relationship is a statistical relationship between two variables that is not due to a direct causal connection between them, but rather is caused by their mutual relationship to a third, underlying variable. [3](https://www.thoughtco.com/spuriousness-3026602)[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurious_relationship)
- For example, there may be a correlation between ice cream sales and drowning rates, but this is likely due to both being influenced by a third factor - hot weather. The relationship between ice cream sales and drownings is spurious. [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurious_relationship)
- Spurious relationships can also arise from coincidence or the presence of a common response variable, confounding factor, or lurking variable that is not accounted for. [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurious_relationship)
- Detecting and eliminating spurious relationships is an important part of statistical analysis and experimental design, as it helps researchers avoid drawing incorrect conclusions about causal relationships. [3](https://www.thoughtco.com/spuriousness-3026602)[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurious_relationship)
- Techniques like control groups and accounting for potential confounding variables can help identify and avoid spurious relationships in research. [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurious_relationship)

In summary, a spurious relationship is a false or misleading statistical correlation that does not reflect a true causal connection between the variables. Recognizing and addressing spurious relationships is crucial for valid statistical inference. [1](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spurious)[2](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/spurious)[3](https://www.thoughtco.com/spuriousness-3026602)[4](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/spurious)[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurious_relationship)
