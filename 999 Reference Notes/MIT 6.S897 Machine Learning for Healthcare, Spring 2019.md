[14. Causal Inference, Part 1 (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkUhg9Wb-I)

**Video summary:**
The video provides an in-depth lecture on causal inference, focusing on the distinction between correlation and causation, and the importance of understanding the underlying data generating process in healthcare. It discusses predictive models, the challenges of extrapolating from observational data, and the necessity of considering causal questions in healthcare decisions. The lecture emphasizes the need for a mathematical language to address causal relationships and introduces concepts like causal graphs, interventions, and counterfactuals.
